Hardware used is Nvidia Jetson Nano with Ubuntu 18.04, with OpenCV 2.4.9 and Python2 installed.

Data is in .jpg.
The video itself is wonky (link: https://youtu.be/GZvi0dwVT-M) 
and it cannot detect what it supposed to detect (which is the wings part of the chick)

I assumed it is because of the training data was very small 
(data trained with image size of 100x100 pixels to avoid giving strain to the hardware)
